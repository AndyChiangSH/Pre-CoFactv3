        "claim": "Mahatma Gandhi having breakfast with British official inside the jail.",
        "evidence": "A photo is being shared on Facebook with a claim that Gandhi was having breakfast with British officials inside the jail while people are fighting for Independence.  Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post. Claim: Mahatma Gandhi having breakfast with British official inside the jail. Fact:  The photo was not taken inside the jail.  It was taken during a breakfast meeting between Gandhi and Mountbatten at Viceroy\u2019s House in April 1947.  Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When the image in the post is run Google Reverse Image Search, a link to Getty Images website containing the same image can be found in the search results.  In that website, the image has a description which reads, \u201cBreakfast meeting between Mahatma Gandhi and Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten 1947\u201d.  Also, in the book \u2018India Remembered\u2019 written by Pamela Mountbatten (the daughter of Lord Mountbatten), the same image can be found in the \u2018A Huge Task\u2019 chapter.  She writes that the photo was taken on 1st April 1947 at the Viceroy\u2019s House.  The Viceroy invited Gandhi for breakfast to discuss the transfer of power, declared by England\u2019s PM Clement R.  Atlee in February 1947.  So, the photo was not taken inside the jail. To sum it up, the photo was taken in April 1947 at the Viceroy\u2019s house, not inside the jail. Did you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)",

        "claim": "#WATCH Rain lashes parts of Kozhikode, Kerala. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for the district tomorrow and predicted isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall. https://t.co/ayBja1AjNc",
        "evidence": "A low-pressure area is likely to develop over east-central Bay of Bengal around June 8 that weather scientists are hoping will not intensify into a cyclone, but become a monsoon depression that will bring widespread and very heavy rains to the region. Cyclone Amphan battered Odisha and West Bengal in the east on May 20, causing widespread damage, but the India Meteorological Department (IMD) doesn\u2019s expect a cyclone this time, said scientist Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD.  \u201c It will most likely be a monsoon depression or a low which will bring a lot of rain to central and east India including Odisha, Chhattisgarh and even Vidarbha.  In some years such troughs form but not every year,\u201d she said.  Parts of Odisha, Chhattigarh and Vidarbha may receive extremely heavy rains (more than 20 cm a day), she said. Cyclones normally don\u2019t develop during the south-west monsoon, which is characterized by strong westerly winds in the lower troposphere (below 5 km) and very strong easterly winds in the upper troposphere (above 9 km).  This results in a large vertical wind shear, which inhibits cyclones, according to Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre for Tropical Cyclones.  During the rainy season, low pressure systems form along the monsoon trough, which extends from northwest India to north Bay of Bengal.  These systems have a short oceanic spell, which is also one of the reasons for inhibiting their development into cyclones. \u201cOdisha, Andhra will get very heavy rainfall first and then other parts of central India starting June 10 for the next three to four days.  Monsoon depressions can cause a lot of rain so it is good for our monsoon,\u201d said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. To be sure, cyclone NIsarga hit Alibaug in Maharashtra\u2019s Raigad last week, bringing heavy rainfall to many parts of the state.  In Raigad, the storm snapped power cables, and uprooted trees and electric poles. \u201cMonsoon doesn\u2019t allow these systems to intensify though we had Nisarga in beginning of the monsoon season in the Arabian Sea, which is slightly unusual.  All low-pressure systems in the Indian Ocean tend to move in west-northwest direction.  They may or may not cross the coast,\u201d said K Sathi Devi, head of the national weather forecasting centre. The new low pressure will develop immediately after remnants of Nisarga disintegrate.  The low pressure area was over Bihar and adjoining northeast Uttar Pradesh on Saturday.  The south-west monsoon has advanced into some more parts of south interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal; most parts of south-west Bay of Bengal, the entire south-east Bay of Bengal; some more parts of east-central Bay of Bengal and some parts of west-central and north-east Bay of Bengal, according to IMD.  Conditions are becoming favourable for further advancement of the monsoon during next 2-3 days. The monsoon is likely to cover most parts of Maharashtra; Odisha and peninsular India by June 10 and all of central India by June 20, Mohapatra said. The average annual frequency of tropical cyclones in the north Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) is about five.  The frequency is more in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea, the ratio being 4:1.  May-June and October-November are known to produce cyclones of severe intensity.  ",

He thanked her in his speech, saying, \"My mom is here somewhere.  Oh, I love you.  I love you lady. \"The camera then panned to her in the audience, hands on her face and overcome with emotion. Malek posted a picture of the two of them on Twitter with a tweet that read, \"So fortunate to have the most supportive woman in my life.  Love you mom! ! ! \"Actors weren't the only ones who brought mom along to the show -- several actresses had their moms by their side for their big night as well. Best actress nominee Yalitza Aparicio had her mom by her side on the Oscars red carpet.  The two held hands and looked stunning in gowns of different shades of blue. Best supporting actress winner Regina King also brought her mom along on the Oscars red carpet. In her acceptance speech, King thanked the people in her life for her Oscars win, saying, \"I'm an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone. \"Academy Award-winning actress Charlize Theron also brought her mother to Oscars.

BOOM contacted Jain who refuted the claims.  We also found that police officials had on July 24 arrested the person who had recorded the audio.  She was later released on bail.   In the nearly 2-minute-long audio, a woman can be heard propagating a conspiracy involving officials of Municipal Corporations, municipalities, private doctors and testing labs.   She says in Hindi, \"Central government  has assigned a sum of Rs 1. 5 lakh to Municipal Corporations and Municipalities to be spent on every individual Corona patient.  Therefore, Municipal Corporation, municipalities, private doctors and labs are focussing on how to get more number of positive tests.  So they are forcefully admitting even those who are suffering from cough and cold and the moment the Rs 1. 5 lakh is approved, the cold is cured and the patient is sent home.

        "evidence": "In April 2022, a set of photographs went viral on social media that supposedly showed a very rare Sumatran striped rabbit that was rescued by authorities after it was offered for sale on Facebook:  The Facebook post reads: \u201cA Sumatran striped rabbit, widely considered to be the rarest rabbit in the world, has been rescued from this man after he puts it on sell on Facebook. The Sumatran Striped Rabit [sic] is one of the rarest breed of rabits [sic]. The rare rabbit has now been safely released back into the forest by the park rangers where is very well tracked by cameras.\u201d This caption does not match up with this set of pictures. The animal in these photographs is not an extremely rare Sumatran striped rabbit. A few months before these photographs went viral, a Sumatran striped rabbit \u2014 an endangered species of rabbit found in Indonesia \u2014 was truly rescued by authorities after the animal was being offered for sale on Facebook. In August 2021, Fauna & Flora International (FFI), an international conservation society dedicated to protecting the planet\u2019s threatened wildlife, announced that they, along with the Kerinci Seblat National Park, had rescued one of these rare rabbits and that it would soon be released back into the wild: Here\u2019s a photograph of the Sumatran striped rabbit that was actually rescued from sale on Facebook:  The Sumatran striped rabbit only grows to about 16 inches in length and is clearly not shown in the viral Facebook photographs at the top of this page. So what kind of rabbit is featured in those photos? And, more importantly, are the photos real? While many social media users commented that the giant rabbit photos were digitally altered, that\u2019s not the case. These are real photographs of a really big rabbit. While it\u2019s possible that some forced perspective is at play here \u2014 an optical trick where an object is made to appear larger than it really is by being placed closer to the camera than other objects in frame \u2014 this rabbit is still quite large. These photographs were posted to a Philippines rabbit breeder Facebook group in February 2022 and appear to show a man holding a German gray giant, a species of rabbit that can grow to nearly 3 feet in length and can weigh up to 25 pounds.
